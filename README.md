# scs-m5-matplotlib-challenge

In this challenge, a pharmaceutical data was given. 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

## The analysis includes
* Generate Summary Statistics
* Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts
* Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot
* Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot
* Calculate Correlation and Regression

## Summary
* In this analysis, Capomulin had the most number of observed mouse timepoints and proporiva had the least

* Within Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin, mice that took Infubinol treatment had the most tumor volumn compared to the rest

* It appears that Capimulin treatment showed a decrease in tumor volumn over time in Mouse ID l509

* There is a strong coorelation (0.84) between mouse weight and the average tumor volume. The r-suquared (0.71) indicate that the tumor volumn can be affected by weight.
